# Lending Club Case Study
> Data is provided for a consumer finance company that specialises in lending different types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, it must make a decision about loan approval based on the applicant's profile. 
We need to make recommendations based on the data so that the finance company can reject loan applications from potential defaulters in the future.

## Key Insights for Mitigating Default Risk in the Lending Process
- **Loan size:** Larger loans tend to have a higher default rate. Consider stricter risk assessment or alternative loan structures for larger amounts.
- **Borrower income:** Lower income borrowers may be higher risk. Utilize a variety of factors like credit score and debt-to-income ratio for informed decisions.
- **Industry sector:** Businesses in certain sectors experience higher default rates. Develop industry-specific lending criteria to mitigate risk.
- **Public record bankruptcies:** Individuals with past bankruptcies pose a higher risk. Leverage this information alongside other factors during loan assessment.

By considering these factors and implementing appropriate strategies, lenders can make informed decisions, minimize defaults, and ensure the financial health of their institutions.
